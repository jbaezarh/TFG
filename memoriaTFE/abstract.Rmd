This undergraduate thesis addresses the problem of daily wildfire prediction in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia using spatial data processing techniques and Machine Learning models.  The time frame of the study is set between 2002 and 2022. Twenty-seven variables are considered in the study belonging to six major categories: anthropogenic, meteorological, topographical, demographic, hydrological and vegetation. The perimeters of forest fires larger than 100 *ha* occurring in Andalusia and obtained from satellite images and field data available in the Environmental Information Network of Andalusia (REDIAM) are used. Methods are implemented to process the spatial datasets collected and generate adequate samples to train predictive models. Thus, a sample of 21,546 records is generated and used to train the models, considering a temporal partition in training-validation-test. The models analysed were: Logistic Regression with penalty, Logistic Regression with penalty using PCA, k-Nearest Neighbours, linear SVM, radial SVM, Decision Trees and Random Forest. Hyperparameter tuning has been carried out usig the validation set and the performance of the tuned models on the test set has been compared usig different metrics. The lasso Logistic Regression and SVM models stood out, achieving the best results in the test set. Finally, the performance of these models was evaluated in two case studies, yielding promising results.
